		<h3 id='prambule'>Pr√©ambule</h3>

<p>First of all, a little notice to tell you that what I&#8217;ll be talking here is two parts mixed in one: it contains a way to write down an issue (bugtracking) &amp;&amp; a way to manage it (process in team). It&#8217;s two different things but I assume you already know what is what and I don&#8217;t want to spend time about it, there&#8217;re so many articles on the internet.</p>

<p>So, I won&#8217;t talk to you about what <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28development%29'>scrum</a> is, what a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugtracker'>bugtracker</a> is. I will talk to you about a tool which allows me to perfectly care my issues in team.</p>

<h3 id='lets_go'>Let&#8217;s go</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m not new in development and managing a bug or an issue is probably one of the hugest part of my job. I worked in some companies and I&#8217;ve seen a lot of ways to manage a bug: it could have been a no-bugtracker-at-all solution and you had to manage yourself the bug coming from an email to another person or it could have been a huge bugtracker with so many options that it was so horrible to use, you lose your mind there.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried all of these bugtrackers for a few months like:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='http://trac.edgewall.org/'>trac</a></li>

<li><a href='http://www.bugzilla.org/'>bugzilla</a></li>

<li><a href='http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/'>jira</a></li>

<li><a href='http://www.redmine.org/'>redmine</a></li>

<li><a href='https://drive.google.com'>a shared google spreadsheet</a> (aye, not fundamentally a bad idea in a small team)</li>

<li>some others I don&#8217;t remember the name</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, and I can say no one satisfied me because I spent more time to try to use it correctly and to respect a process that it wasn&#8217;t mine. I felt like inflexible and can&#8217;t write down quickly a note or a bug.</p>

<p>So okay, I&#8217;ve done my part about bugtracking. Now, about process. Well, nothing to say about process to be honest. I just can tell you that I&#8217;ve tried scrum, it works or not, depending on how your entreprise is, how people are, how people take serious this process. 6 months before, I could have said &#8220;fuck yeah, work with scrum method, it&#8217;s the way to succeed!&#8221;. But now, it ain&#8217;t anymore. Too much process can kill the process.</p>

<h3 id='fact'>Fact</h3>

<p>Well. throw away all these shits and let&#8217;s talk about a solution I can say: yes, that&#8217;s how I will work now.</p>

<p>As professional git repo, we choose <a href='https://github.com/'>Github</a>. Ok. <a href='https://github.com/'>Github</a> provides Github issues solution. Well, ok. You have tickets, you can assign a ticket to someone, you can choose a label, comment the ticket. But? There&#8217;s no priority management. It&#8217;s a shame, yes. That&#8217;s where <a href='http://huboard.com/'>huboard</a> comes and saves the world.</p>

<h3 id='huboard_the_solution'>Huboard, the solution</h3>

<p><a href='http://huboard.com/'>Huboard</a> is simply an <a href='https://github.com/rauhryan/huboard'>open source application</a> written in ruby which allows you to manage the priorities of github issues. Just that, you see. It&#8217;s based on <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28development%29'>scrum</a> or <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban'>kanban</a> (yes I don&#8217;t see for the moment the true difference but anyway) and it lets you to choose the priority of a ticket.</p>

<p>You have four columns: <code>Backlog</code>, <code>Ready</code>, <code>Working</code>, <code>Done</code>. You place tickets wherever you want and you move them between these columns. Aye, you&#8217;ve created life to your tickets! \o/</p>

<p>Now, let&#8217;s see in pictures.</p>

<p><img alt='huboard project list' src='/blog/medias/img/huboard-1.png' /></p>

<p>Here you&#8217;ve got your projects.</p>

<p><img alt='huboard ticket management' src='/blog/medias/img/huboard-2.png' /></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s your project board.</p>

<p>You can filter your tickets by assignment, labels. You can see your milestones, your backlog, etc. And that&#8217;s all.</p>

<h3 id='how_it_works_behind'>How it works behind</h3>

<p>To work with github, <a href='http://huboard.com/'>huboard</a> asks some low permissions like - to be honest - almost all permissions. Yes, I see you to be afraid but let me explain how it works.</p>

<p>It has no database, it just asks you permissions and the only things it does are to add some labels (Backlog, Ready, &#8230;) to know the life of the issues and to add a comment like <code>&lt;!--- @huboard:{&quot;order&quot;:42.6875}    --&gt;</code> to know the priority (verticale way so).</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t trust the online version (and I can understand you, it was my first reaction) well, let&#8217;s have a try to the local version. Yes, because you can install your own <a href='http://huboard.com/'>huboard</a>. Just <a href='https://github.com/rauhryan/huboard#to-run-locally'>follow the commander</a>.</p>

<h3 id='why_huboard_and_not_other_scrumkanbanlike_apps'>Why Huboard and not other scrum/kanban-like apps?</h3>

<p><a href='http://huboard.com/'>Huboard</a> is simple, open source, free, clean about design and the reactivity of the maintainer(s) is amazing (say hello to <a href='https://twitter.com/rauhryan'>@rauhryan</a> or <a href='https://twitter.com/huboard'>@huboard</a> ;))</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried <a href='https://trello.com/'>trello</a> and <a href='https://kanbanery.com/'>kanbanery</a> to organise my/our cards. Well, nope. I can&#8217;t use them. Ugly, boring, not open source (right?). <a href='https://kanbanery.com/'>Kanbanery</a> is ok but why I prefer <a href='http://huboard.com/'>huboard</a> to <a href='https://kanbanery.com/'>kanbanery</a>? <a href='https://kanbanery.com/'>Kanbanery</a>, you create your cards, you create your github issues and you <strong>have to</strong> link your github issues or/and your commits to your cards. It means <a href='https://kanbanery.com/'>kanbanery</a> can use <a href='https://github.com/'>Github</a> but it forces you to do some copy/paste to use the github feature, which is boring. <a href='http://huboard.com/'>Huboard</a> does not do like that. <a href='http://huboard.com/'>Huboard</a> is a wrapper on github and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m loving it. You have nothing to do, it&#8217;s already synchronised with github and you just have to manage your card priorities, cards which are already created in Github Issues. How wonderful it is.</p>

<h3 id='bonus'>Bonus</h3>

<p>Yes, there&#8217;s a bonus. Yeeeeehaa. If you want to improve your github issue skills, I advise you to use this excellent github issue client (cli client) called <a href='https://github.com/stephencelis/ghi'>ghi</a>. Simple, efficient. You really should have a try.</p>

<p><img alt='ghi man' src='/blog/medias/img/ghi-man.png' /></p>

<p><img alt='ghi list' src='/blog/medias/img/ghi-list.png' /></p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: <a href='http://huboard.com/'>huboard</a> + <a href='https://github.com/stephencelis/ghi'>ghi</a> for the win.</p>
